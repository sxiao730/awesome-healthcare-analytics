## Understanding Healthcare Data

### Types of Healthcare Data
- **Clinical Data**: Patient health information, treatment records, medical history.
- **Claims Data**: Insurance claim information, billing details.
- **Pharmaceutical Data**: Drug prescriptions, medication adherence data.
- **Patient Demographics**: Age, gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status.


### Data Governance and Compliance
- [**HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act)**](#https://www.hhs.gov/hipaa/for-professionals/index.html): a U.S. law that sets national standards to protect sensitive patient health information from being disclosed without the patient's consent or knowledge.
- [**GDPR (General Data Protection Regulation)**](#https://gdpr.eu/recital-53-processing-of-sensitive-data-in-health-and-social-sector/): a comprehensive data protection law in the EU that mandates strict privacy and security measures for personal data, significantly impacting healthcare by requiring robust protection and responsible handling of patient information.

### Reference Files for Organizing Healthcare Data

#### ICD Codes (International Classification of Diseases)
- **Description**: A global diagnostic tool developed by the World Health Organization (WHO) for epidemiology, health management, and clinical purposes, standardizing the reporting of diseases and health conditions.

- **Data Format**: Alphanumeric codes.
- **Subtypes**:
  - **ICD-9-CM(Clinical Modification)**: Used historically in U.S. since 1979 and being replaced by ICD-10(below) in October 2015. The codes are mostly numeric between 3-5 digits long with a few exceptions with leading alphabets. 
    - **Expected Value Example**: 250.00 (Type 2 diabetes without complication).
  - **ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification)**: Adopted in the U.S. in October 2015 systematically for diagnosis coding, providing a detailed classification of diseases and health-related problems. It consists of alphanumeric codes that are typically 3 to 7 characters in length.
    - **Expected Value Example**: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications).
  - **ICD-10-PCS (Procedure Coding System)**: Used for **inpatient** procedures in U.S. hospitals, describing surgical, medical, and diagnostic services.Outpatient procedures are coded under CPT.

- **Purpose**: Helps coders, health care providers, and researchers convert data from ICD-9-CM to the more detailed ICD-10 system, supporting data continuity and comparability.
- **Update Frequency**: annually. 
- **Data Format**: GEMs files contain tables mapping ICD-9-CM codes to their most appropriate ICD-10 equivalents (and vice versa), with each mapping typically represented as a pair of ICD-9 and ICD-10 codes.

Cases are classified into MS-DRGs for payments based on the principal diagnosis, up to 24 additional diagnoses, and up to 25 procedures performed during the stay. A small portion of MS-DRGs are also based on the patient's age, sex, and discharge status.
