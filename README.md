- **Update Frequency**:
- **Data Format**: Alphanumeric codes.
- **Subtypes**:
  - **ICD-9**: Used historically before being replaced by ICD-10 in October 2015. It used a mix of numeric and alphanumeric codes up to 5 characters in length.
    - **Expected Value Example**: 250.00 (Type 2 diabetes without complication).
  - **ICD-10-CM (Clinical Modification)**: Adopted in the U.S. for diagnosis coding, providing a detailed classification of diseases and health-related problems.
    - **Expected Value Example**: E11.9 (Type 2 diabetes mellitus without complications).
  - **ICD-10-PCS (Procedure Coding System)**: Used for inpatient procedures in U.S. hospitals, describing surgical, medical, and diagnostic services.
    - **Expected Value Example**: 0HDBXZZ (Excision of liver, percutaneous endoscopic approach).

### CPT Codes (Current Procedural Terminology)
- **Description**: Describes medical, surgical, and diagnostic services and procedures.
- **Purpose**: Essential for billing and coding, providing a standardized system for medical procedures.
- **Update Frequency**:
- **Data Format**: Five-digit numeric codes (e.g., 99213 for a standard office visit).
- [Learn More About CPT Codes](#cpt-codes-link)

### NDC (National Drug Codes)
- **Description**: Unique identifier for human drugs in the United States.
- **Purpose**: Used for pharmacy billing and inventory management, tracking drug prescriptions and utilization.
- **Update Frequency**:
- **Data Format**: 10-digit numeric code in a 4-4-2, 5-4-1, or 5-3-2 format (e.g., 1234-5678-90).

- **Purpose**: Used in Medicare and other insurance programs for consistent billing and coding.
- **Update Frequency**:
- **Data Format**: Alphanumeric codes, including a single letter followed by four digits (e.g., G0008 for flu vaccination administration).
- [Learn More About HCPCS](#hcpcs-link)

### RVU (Relative Value Unit)
- **Description**: A system that assigns value to medical services to standardize costs based on time, skill, and resources required.
- **Purpose**: Utilized in calculating physician reimbursement rates, especially in the Medicare Physician Fee Schedule, and widely adopted in other healthcare reimbursement models.
- **Update Frequency**: Quarterly
- **Data Format**: Numerical values, often represented in a table format alongside corresponding medical services. For example, a specific procedure might have a Work RVU of 3.00, a Practice Expense RVU of 1.50, and a Malpractice RVU of 0.30.

- **Purpose**: Helps in estimating anesthesia risk and planning patient care by providing a standardized way to communicate patient health status.
- **Update Frequency**: Revised as needed, based on updates in clinical practice guidelines and anesthesiology research.
- **Data Format**: Categorical scale ranging from ASA I to ASA VI. For example, ASA I indicates a healthy patient, ASA II a patient with mild systemic disease, and ASA III a patient with severe systemic disease.
